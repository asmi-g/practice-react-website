# practice-react-website

This is code for my first website using React. The code was written such that
all of the JSX elements are written in JS files, and during file organization, though an
effort to import headers, footers, and the required JSX components was made, I could not 
find the appropriate React dependency modules, so the code will not work.

This will be fixed with the next React project I make, which will be made through
using the create-react-app command.
